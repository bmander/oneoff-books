## Fundamentals of Surveying

### Definition of Surveying
**Definition of Surveying**

Surveying, at its most basic, can be defined as the science and art of determining relative positions of points on, above, or beneath the Earth's surface. These points are typically represented by three-dimensional coordinates (latitude, longitude, and elevation) and are used for various applications ranging from construction and engineering to map-making and land division. 

Surveying involves precise measurement of distances, directions, and angles between different land points. The gathered data is then used to create maps, establish property boundaries, or guide construction projects.

Different types of surveying are typically recognized, each with its unique focus and application:

1. **Geodetic Surveying**: This type of surveying takes into account the curvature of the Earth. Geodetic surveys cover large areas and provide a high degree of accuracy, making them crucial for national and international mapping projects.

2. **Topographic Surveying**: Topographic surveys focus on determining the position of natural and man-made features of the land, including hills, valleys, roads, and buildings. They are often used for creating topographic maps and planning land use.

3. **Cadastral Surveying**: Often referred to as boundary surveying, cadastral surveys deal with the definition and demarcation of property boundaries. This was particularly important in the 19th century America, where new lands needed to be accurately divided and allotted.

4. **Engineering Surveying**: Engineering surveys are typically performed before, during, and after construction projects. They provide the necessary data for the design and implementation of engineering works, such as bridges, roads, and buildings.

### Basic Principles of Surveying

#### Working from Whole to Part Principle

The 'working from whole to part' principle is a fundamental concept in surveying. It dictates that larger, more general measurements should be established first, followed by increasingly detailed and localized measurements. This process helps maintain accuracy by reducing the cumulative errors that can occur when many small measurements are combined.

For example, in the context of a large surveying project, surveyors would first establish a framework of control points covering the entire area. These control points, determined with high precision, form the 'whole'. Further detailed measurements within this framework, or the 'parts', would then be referenced back to these control points. This systematic approach minimizes the propagation of errors from one measurement to the next.

In the 19th century America, this principle was crucial during the implementation of the Public Land Survey System (PLSS). The PLSS was a monumental task aimed at dividing the newly acquired Western territories into sellable parcels. The 'whole to part' principle was applied by first establishing principal meridians and base lines ('the whole') across the territories. These served as reference lines from which smaller divisions like townships and sections ('the parts') were subsequently measured and demarcated.

#### Principle of Independent Checks

The principle of independent checks is another cornerstone in surveying, acting as a safeguard against errors and inaccuracies. It involves independently re-measuring or re-calculating key data to validate the original measurements or calculations.

This principle is vital for maintaining the integrity of surveying data. Errors can occur due to a multitude of factors, such as equipment malfunction, environmental conditions, or human error. By independently verifying the measurements, surveyors can identify and correct these errors before they impact the final survey results.

In the context of manual surveying, independent checks often involved a second surveyor or team re-measuring significant points or distances. For example, in the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad in the 19th century, different surveying teams would often cross-check each other's work. This was crucial in ensuring the accuracy of the track alignment and gradients over the vast distances covered by the railroad.

Moreover, computational checks were common for complex calculations, such as determining the area of irregular parcels of land. A surveyor might calculate the area using one method and then check the result using a different method.

#### Accuracy Standards and Requirements

Accuracy in surveying is paramount, and different types and purposes of surveys necessitate varying levels of accuracy. For instance, a cadastral survey, which determines property boundaries, requires high precision due to the legal implications of the results. On the other hand, a topographic survey, aimed at identifying the general shape and characteristics of the land, might not require the same degree of accuracy.

In the 19th century, maintaining and verifying accuracy standards presented unique challenges. Surveyors had to contend with less precise equipment, rugged terrains, and vast distances. Despite these constraints, certain methods were employed to uphold accuracy standards.

First, the selection of appropriate surveying equipment and techniques was critical. For example, theodolites, known for their precision, were often used for tasks requiring high accuracy, such as establishing the principal meridians in the Public Land Survey System.

Second, routine calibration of equipment ensured that tools remained accurate over time. This was especially vital for tools like the surveyor's compass and chain, which could easily be affected by wear and tear.

Third, as discussed earlier, the principle of independent checks served as an essential mechanism for verifying accuracy. Redundant measurements and calculations were often performed to identify and rectify potential errors.

#### Maintaining a Comprehensive Field Book

The field book plays an essential role in surveying. It serves as a detailed record of all the measurements and observations made during a survey. Maintaining a comprehensive and accurate field book is crucial for preserving the integrity of the survey data and providing a reference for future analysis or dispute resolution.

In the 19th century, the field book was a surveyor's constant companion. It typically included records of the following information:

- The date, time, and location of the survey
- Weather and environmental conditions, which could affect measurements
- The equipment used and any calibration procedures performed
- A log of all measurements taken, including distances, angles, and elevations
- Descriptions and sketches of notable land features
- Records of any difficulties or anomalies encountered during the survey

This exhaustive record played a vital role in preserving data integrity. It ensured that the raw data from the survey could be reviewed and re-analyzed if necessary. For instance, if a dispute arose about a property boundary, the field book could provide the original measurements and observations to inform the resolution.

Furthermore, the field book supported the principles of working from whole to part and independent checks. Surveyors could refer back to their initial measurements and observations as they worked on more detailed sections of the survey, and other surveyors could review the field book to verify the original data.

### Components of Surveying

Surveying is a multifaceted discipline that utilizes a range of measurements to accurately represent the physical world. It is anchored on three fundamental components: distance measurement, angle measurement, and elevation measurement. Together, these components form the basis of land division and allocation.

**Distance Measurement:** Central to surveying, distance measurement involves determining the linear separation between two points. This measurement is crucial for establishing the size of a parcel of land, defining property boundaries, and planning construction projects. In the 19th century, this was often accomplished using chains or tapes, with meticulous methods employed to ensure accuracy.

**Angle Measurement:** Surveying also requires the measurement of angles, typically those formed between lines from a common origin. Angular measurements help to determine the direction of survey lines and, when combined with distance measurements, enable the accurate plotting of land features. Traditional tools such as compasses and theodolites were commonly used for this purpose.

**Elevation Measurement:** The determination of differences in height, or leveling, is another essential surveying component. Leveling provides information about the topography of the land, which is necessary for drainage planning, road construction, and many other applications. Simple leveling instruments such as the hand level and more complex devices like the theodolite were used to perform these measurements in the 19th century.

**Land Division:** These measurements of distance, angle, and elevation come together in the process of land division. Surveyors use these data to divide land into parcels, establish boundaries, and create detailed maps. This process was especially important in 19th century America, facilitating organized settlement and land ownership.

### Surveying Techniques

Several techniques have been developed over the centuries to make surveying more accurate and efficient. These methods have evolved significantly, but the principles underlying them remain consistent. Among these techniques are triangulation, traversing, and radiation, each of which plays a critical role in the surveying process.

**Triangulation:** This technique involves forming triangles between points to determine unknown distances and angles. By measuring the length of one side of the triangle (the baseline) and the angles to an unknown point, surveyors can calculate the distances to that point using trigonometry. Triangulation was a vital technique in the 19th century, particularly for large-scale surveys where direct measurement of long distances was impractical.

**Traversing:** Traversing is a method of establishing control networks, a series of connected lines whose lengths and directions are measured. The process begins from an initial station with known coordinates, and consecutive points are determined using measured angles and distances. Unlike triangulation, which uses a network of triangles, traversing relies on a sequence of connected lines, often following the features of the land or the boundaries of an area.

**Radiation:** The radiation technique involves drawing lines from a central point to various points on the boundary of a survey area. By measuring these radial lines, surveyors can accurately plot the boundary points on a map. Radiation is particularly useful for small areas or where the entire area can be seen from one point.

These techniques, each with its unique advantages and applications, were fundamental to the practice of surveying in the 19th century. They allowed surveyors to accurately map and measure the land, shaping the physical and social landscape of America.

### Challenges in Surveying

Surveying in the 19th century was fraught with a unique set of challenges, many of which arose from the era's technological limitations and environmental conditions. 

**Terrain and Accessibility:** The rugged and diverse landscapes of 19th-century America presented a significant hurdle. Vast, unexplored territories, dense forests, and steep mountain ranges made access difficult. Surveyors often had to blaze their own trails, carrying heavy equipment through inhospitable environments.

**Accuracy and Precision:** Given the rudimentary technology of the time, maintaining high levels of accuracy and precision was challenging. Errors could creep into measurements due to the limitations of the manual instruments, while environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity could also affect readings.

**Data Recording and Management:** Keeping meticulous records was crucial, yet difficult given the absence of digital technology. Field books had to be kept up-to-date and accurate, as they were the only record of the measurements taken. Any loss or damage to these books could result in the loss of valuable data.

To overcome these challenges, surveyors had to rely on their skills, resourcefulness, and a deep understanding of the principles of surveying. Adaptability was key when facing difficult terrains, often requiring the implementation of different surveying techniques depending on the circumstances. To address issues of accuracy, surveyors employed methods such as repeated measurements and independent checks. As for data management, the disciplined maintenance of comprehensive field books was critical, as they served as both a working document and an archival record.

These challenges, while daunting, drove innovation and the development of new techniques, contributing to the evolution of surveying from a manual to a digital discipline.

## Manual Surveying Equipment of the 19th Century

### Distance Measuring Tools

#### Chains and Tapes

Surveying in the 19th century relied heavily on chains and tapes for distance measurement. These tools were meticulously crafted to exact lengths, offering a reliable means to measure linear distances on the field.

Different types of chains and tapes were employed, each with its own specifications. A commonly used one was the Gunter's chain, a 66-foot long chain composed of 100 links. Another was the engineer's chain, measuring 100 feet with 100 links. Steel tapes, which came into use later in the century, provided a more durable and less cumbersome alternative.

The method of using chains and tapes, often referred to as chaining, involved laying the chain or tape along the ground between two points and counting the number of complete chain or tape lengths, then adding the additional length for partial lengths. 

Accuracy with chains and tapes was generally high, but several factors could affect it. The temperature could cause the metal to expand or contract, and the tension applied during measurement could also alter the length. Corrections often had to be made for slope when measuring across uneven terrain.

Despite their utility, chains and tapes had limitations. They required significant time and labor to use and were susceptible to wear and tear. The need for regular maintenance and calibration was therefore essential to ensure their continued accuracy.

#### Rods and Staves

Rods and staves served as another set of tools for measuring distances in the 19th century. These were typically made of wood and marked with graduations for different units of length.

Their use often complemented that of other equipment. For instance, they could be used in conjunction with a chain for distance measurement, or with a theodolite for determining horizontal angles. 

Rods and staves provided reasonable accuracy, but, as with chains and tapes, several factors could influence this. The condition of the wood, the precision of the markings, and the care with which they were used all played a part.

The use of rods and staves was not without challenges. Uneven terrain could make their placement difficult, and their wooden construction meant they were susceptible to weather conditions, requiring careful storage and maintenance. Despite these challenges, their convenience and utility made them a staple in the surveyor's toolkit.

### Angle Measuring Tools

#### Compass

A primary tool for measuring angles in the 19th century was the compass. In particular, the magnetic compass was a mainstay of the surveyor's toolkit. This simple device, consisting of a magnetized needle free to align itself with the Earth's magnetic field, provided a reference direction from which other angles could be measured.

The compass was typically housed in a box with a circle divided into 360 degrees around the needle. The surveyor would align the zero-degree mark with a baseline or a known direction, then measure the angle between this baseline and the target direction. Though it was quick to use and easy to transport, the magnetic compass was limited by local magnetic variations and could not provide the level of precision required for some surveying tasks.

#### Transit

The transit instrument was an advancement over the compass in terms of angle measurement. It featured a telescope mounted on a tripod, which could be rotated horizontally or vertically to measure angles. The telescope's line of sight provided a precise reference direction, and a circle graduated into degrees allowed for accurate angle readings.

Transits offered several advantages over compasses. They were less affected by local magnetic variations and provided more accurate angle measurements. They also allowed for both horizontal and vertical angles to be measured, expanding their utility in surveying tasks.

However, transits were also more complex to use and required a trained operator. Their delicate components needed regular maintenance and careful handling to prevent damage.

#### Theodolite

The theodolite represented a further advancement in angle measuring tools. This precision instrument was capable of measuring both horizontal and vertical angles with a high degree of accuracy. Like the transit, it featured a telescope for sighting and graduated circles for angle measurement.

The theodolite was particularly well-suited to triangulation surveys, where the accurate measurement of angles was critical. Its use allowed for greater precision in mapping and land division tasks, contributing to the advancement of surveying techniques in the 19th century.

Despite its advantages, the theodolite was a complex instrument that required a skilled operator. Its use in the field also demanded careful setup and calibration, adding to the time and effort required for surveying tasks.

### Leveling Instruments

#### Spirit Level

The spirit level is a simple yet indispensable tool in the field of surveying. It is primarily used to establish horizontal planes and to adjust other surveying instruments. The device, generally a small, transparent tube partially filled with a liquid (usually colored alcohol), has an air bubble that settles at the highest point in the tube, indicating a balanced or 'level' position.

When placed on a surface, the position of the bubble within the marked lines on the tube indicates whether the surface is level. If the bubble rests between the lines, the surface is level; if not, the surface is tilted. This tool was commonly used by surveyors in the 19th century to ensure their equipment was properly aligned, contributing to the accuracy of their measurements.

#### Dumpy Level

The dumpy level was a popular leveling instrument used in the 19th century. This device, essentially a telescope with a spirit level fixed to it, was mounted on a tripod for stability. By observing through the telescope, surveyors could measure height differences and construct grades with precision.

To use a dumpy level, the surveyor would set up the device on a stable surface and adjust it until the bubble in the spirit level was centered, indicating that the instrument was level. A staff rod with graduated measurements was then placed at the point to be measured. The surveyor would look through the telescope, aligning the crosshairs with the markings on the staff rod to take a reading.

The dumpy level was valued for its simplicity and accuracy in determining elevations and depressions. It was widely used in the construction of roads, railways, and canals, where maintaining a consistent grade was crucial.

In summary, the spirit level and dumpy level were essential tools in 19th-century surveying. They helped surveyors establish level planes, measure height differences, and ensure the accuracy of their work. Despite their simplicity, these instruments were fundamental to the development of surveying and construction techniques during this period.
